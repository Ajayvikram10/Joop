# Java Object-Oriented Programming - Joop
A tool for learning object-oriented programming in Java written in JavaFX. 

The user can write Java classes in the code editor, compile them and view them in a class diagram. The user can create objects by invoking constructors on the class diagram. Objects are visualized in a object diagram through which the user can invoke methods on objects and view how their internal states change.
