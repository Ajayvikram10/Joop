# Joop
A visual and educational object-oriented programming learning tool written in JavaFX. The user can write classes which are compiled 
on the fly and drawn in a UML class diagram. The user can then create objects by right-clicking the class and selecting a constructor. The objects are drawn in a separate object diagram. The user is also able to invoke any methods on the object and view how the internal state changes. 

Status: 

Currently working on the compilation mechanism. Classes can be compiled but the drawing of the diagrams has not yet been implemented.
