# Java Object-Oriented Programming - Joop
An educational object-oriented programming learning tool written in JavaFX. The user can write classes with the code editor that can be compiled on the fly and viewed in a UML class diagram. The user can also create objects by invoking constructors through the class diagram. Objects are visualized in a UML object diagram through which the user can invoke methods on objects and view how their internal states change.
